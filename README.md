# Shakepay Python Interface
## _Fully functional replacement for the app_


The module is designed to be as simple and flexable as possible, so most functions return raw values. All functions have DOCSTRINGS if you are confused on what they do, but most function are pretty self explanatory.

If you are intrested in creating your own auth system instead of using the quick_auth function, look inside `shakepay_api/test.py` and `shakepay_api/authentication.py` for more information on how you should handle interaction.

## Examples

- `example_trigger_shackingsats.py` - authenticates the user and retrives the shacking sats rewards
- `example_get_authentication.py` - authenticates the user and retrives wallet information
- `example_send_cad.py` - authenticates the user and attempts to send 1$

The API will eventually be fully documented but I tried to make it as human friendly as possible if you do a little digging inside the files and look at the examples.

## Improvements

Feel free to create an issue if you belive an improvement could be made!
